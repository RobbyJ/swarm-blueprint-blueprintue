Plugin for Swarm (web layer Perforce) that allows for the viewing of Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) Blueprints when it finds Blueprint files in the text format (COFF format).

Uses BlueprintUE.com (http://blueprintue.com) - you will need to contact them for an API license so that you can connect and submit Blueprints.

An example of this in use can be seen here: https://youtu.be/3iQLJbWPNCs

Current Limitations
Blueprint needs to be in the COFF file format which is done by exporting the Blueprint in the editor (right-click on a Blueprint->Asset Action->Export, you get a .COPY file which contains the Blueprint in COFF format).
